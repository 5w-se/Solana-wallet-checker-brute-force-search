# Solana Wallet Checker Brute-Force Search: Exploring Solana Security

**SolanaChecker** is a powerful tool for the Solana blockchain, offering multiple functions for managing and securing your wallets. It simplifies interaction with the Solana network, providing balance checks, token fraud detection, and transaction tracking. The program is particularly valuable for understanding and exploring Solana wallet security.

6.  **Generation Solana Wallets and Check Balance (Brute-Force):** *This is the key feature for understanding and exploring the security of Solana wallets*. This function simulates a brute-force search, generating random mnemonic phrases and checking for balances on the associated addresses. *It is intended ONLY for educational purposes*. The program writes found wallets to 'found-wallets.txt' and sends Telegram notifications (if set up).

## Setting up Telegram Notifications

Configure Telegram to receive notifications. Add your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the 'telegram-settings.txt' file.

## Getting Started: Download or Build

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself for greater security.

## Building the Project: Emphasizing Security and Control

Building the project from the source code is strongly recommended. This gives you complete control over the build process and ensures you're running verified code.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it.
2.  Add vcpkg to your system PATH.
3.  Run the following:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Build the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is correctly integrated with your environment.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be found in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Make sure all dependencies are accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile using (example):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: Brute-Force and Security

Use the command line for the brute-force search and security functions:

1.  **-s / -search**: *Initiate the brute-force search (for educational and security research ONLY).*
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Track a specified address.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate a number of Solana wallets.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Retrieve information about a wallet using the seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Check the balance of a Solana address.

## Notes

-   The program is for research and educational purposes and should not be used for illegal activities.
-   All cryptocurrency operations carry risks.
-   Protect your seed phrases and wallets.
